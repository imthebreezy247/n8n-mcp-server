## Copyright Law Overview

### United States (DMCA)

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) protects copyrighted works including:
- Movies and films
- Television shows
- Music and soundtracks
- Video content

**Unauthorized use is illegal** unless covered by specific exceptions.

### International Laws

Similar laws exist worldwide:
- **EU**: Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC
- **UK**: Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988
- **Canada**: Copyright Act
- **Australia**: Copyright Act 1968

---

## Fair Use Doctrine (US)

Fair use MAY allow limited use of copyrighted material for:
- Commentary and criticism
- News reporting
- Teaching and education
- Parody and transformative works

### Four Fair Use Factors:

1. **Purpose and character** of use
   - Commercial vs. educational
   - Transformative nature

2. **Nature of copyrighted work**
   - Published vs. unpublished
   - Creative vs. factual

3. **Amount used**
   - 2 minutes from a 2-hour movie = ~1.7%
   - BUT: Quality matters more than quantity
   - Using the "heart" of the work is problematic

4. **Effect on market value**
   - Does it harm original's market?
   - Could it substitute for the original?

### Fair Use Analysis for This Project

**Likely NOT Fair Use because:**

- **Purpose**: Entertainment on TikTok (not educational/critical)
- **Commercial**: TikTok monetization opportunities
- **Amount**: Taking the "best" 2 minutes
- **Market Effect**: Could reduce desire to watch original
- **Not transformative**: Simply re-posting existing content

**Consult a lawyer** for specific fair use questions.
